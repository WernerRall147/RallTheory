# Technology is an extension of your creativity... What will you build?

## This is my attempt at creating "container" based solutions, where every folder is a solution to a question, problem or business need that I tried to solve. Feel free to contribute, ask questions and recommend changes.

## The Technology stack included in this repo is a collection of all the Technologies I have been exposed to in my IT Career. Ensure you understand which technology they apply to and have a growth mindset if there is something you do not understand. 

## Folder Structure:
Every Folder is a solution

## Scripts/Tools/Technologies:
- PowerShell
- Terraform
- Azure ARM Templates
- PowerBI Templates
- PowerAutomate

- and many more...
