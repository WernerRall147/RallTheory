# PSDesiredStateConfiguration High Quality Resource Module Plan

Any comments or questions about this plan can be submitted under issue
[#160](https://github.com/PowerShell/xPSDesiredStateConfiguration/issues/160)

## Goals

1. Port the appropriate in-box DSC Resources to the open-source
   xPSDesiredStateConfiguration resource module.
1. Make the open-source xPSDesiredStateConfiuration resource module a **High
   Quality Resource Module (HQRM)** to present to the community for feedback.

The PSDesiredStateConfiguration High Quality Resource Module will consist of
the following resources:

- Archive
- Environment
- Group
- GroupSet
- Package
- Process
- ProcessSet
- PSSessionConfiguration
- Registry
- Script
- Service
- ServiceSet
- User
- WindowsFeature
- WindowsFeatureSet
- WindowsOptionalFeature
- WindowsOptionalFeatureSet
- WindowsPackageCab

## Port In-Box Only Resources

We will port the appropriate in-box resources that will be in the HQRM to the
open-source xPSDesiredStateConfiguration resource module. These resources are
not currently in the open-source repository. Resources currently both in-box
and open-source will be merged in step 2.

### In-Box Only Resources Moving to Open-Source HQRM

These resources and any of their tests, examples, or documentation will be
moved to the xPSDSC open-source repository:

- Environment
- GroupSet
- ProcessSet
- Script
- ServiceSet
- User
- WindowsFeature
- WindowsFeatureSet
- WindowsOptionalFeatureSet
- WindowsPackageCab (**NEW**)

When these resources are moved to GitHub, they will have 'x' appended before
their names for now to indicate that they are still 'experimental' in this
stage. This 'x' convention will change in the near future. The 'x' can be
removed as part of step 5.

## Merge In-Box and Open-Source Resources

We will merge in-box resources that are also currently in the open-source
module. The in-box resources and any of their tests, examples, or documentation
will be merged into the existing open-source resources in the
xPSDesiredStateConfiguration resource module.

Four of the current open-source resources are not provided in-box. The fate of
these open-source-only resources has been addressed in this step as well.

### Open-Source Resources Moving to HQRM

\* = open-source only

- Archive
- Group
- PSSessionConfiguration*
- Package
- Process
- Registry
- Service
- WindowsOptionalFeature

These resources will retain the 'x' appended before their names for now to
indicate that they are still 'experimental' in this stage. This 'x' convention
will change in the near future. The 'x' can be removed as part of step 5.

### Open-Source Resources Not Moving to HQRM

#### Resource Name: FileUpload

##### Reason Not To Move

This should be part of the File resource. We do not want this released as an
official, supported resource when we are planning to change it in the future.

#### Resource Name: RemoteFile

##### Reason Not To Move

This should be part of the File resource. We do not want this released as an
official, supported resource when we are planning to change it in the future.

#### Resource Name: DscWebService

##### Reason Not To Move

This resource is currently on hold. It is not in current plans for
PSDscResources.

## Resolve Nano Server vs Full Server Resources

Some of the in-box resources (User especially) currently contain
all-encompassing if-statements which tells the resource to act differently
based on whether it is operating on a Nano server or a full server. These
if-statements will make the resources difficult to maintain.

### Potential Solutions

#### Solution: Leave the if-statements

##### Pros

- No time needed for fix.

##### Cons

- Difficult to maintain.
- User has to download/store extra code. (minimal)

#### Solution: Use the Nano server version only

##### Pros

- Code will be easy to maintain.
- May be a cleaner, simpler implementation for full server.
- User does not have to download/store extra code. (minimal)

##### Cons

- May break the resources.
- Requires fixing time.
- Requires testing.

#### Solution: Separate the Nano and full server versions into separate resources

##### Pros

- User can download only the resource version they need.

##### Cons

- Will have to maintain separate version.
- Requires fixing time.
- Requires testing.

## Update Each Resource to Be High Quality

We will update the resouces, tests, exmaples, and documentation to ensure that
the xPSDesiredStateConfiguration resource module meets the requirements to be a
High Quality Resource Module (HQRM). These requirements can be found in the DSC
Resource Kit High Quality Plan (not yet published publicly, sorry).  

Here are the basic steps we will have to take based on this plan:  

1. Fix PSSA issues per the DSC Resource Kit PSSA Rule Severity List (not yet
   published publicly, sorry).
1. Ensure unit tests are present for each resource with more than 70% code
   coverage.
1. Ensure examples run correctly, work as expected, and are documented clearly.
1. Ensure clear documentation is provided.
1. Ensure the PSDesiredStateConfiguration module follows the standard DSC
   Resource Kit module format.
1. Fix code styling to match the
   [DSC Resource Kit Style Guidelines](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/blob/master/StyleGuidelines.md).

## Resolve Name of New High Quality Resource Module

The new High Quality Resource Module (HQRM) for xPSDesiredStateConfiguration is
named [PSDscResources](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSDscResources).

It cannot be named PSDesiredStateCongfiguration since that would conflict with
the in-box module, but this HQRM will not contain all the resources in the
in-box module (File, Log cannot be ported).

All resources will have the 'x' removed in the HQRM.

## Move Resources to New High Quality Module

Each resource is transferred to the HQRM when it is ready with these steps:

1. Rename the resource in all files (remove the 'x').
1. Submit a PR with the new resource to the PSDscResources repository.
