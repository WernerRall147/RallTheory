# Introduction
Now that Azure Update Manager is the most supported way to patch your Azure VMs I decided to create some Pre and Post Tasks. The First pre task will be to Start up certain VM's that have tags. The next pre task will be to do a snapshot of the OS Disk in case the patch does anything unwanted we can very easily create a disk from the Snapshot. *There will be more pre and post tasks added as required.
